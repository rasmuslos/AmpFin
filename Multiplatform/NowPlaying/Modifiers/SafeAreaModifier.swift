     This thing is very funny, we will need this due to how Apple implemented NavigationSplitView.
     The NavigationSplitView is implemented with a wrapper around UIKit, so not a SwiftUI native component.
     A SwiftUI way to determine if we need the offset to make space for the sidebar is to monitor the binded
     value columnVisibility of the NavigationSplitView, but since this is a UIKit wrapped component, this value
     changes AFTER the view change has been committed, which means when the size of the view changes and triggers
     SwiftUI update, this value will not change until all animations are done. The onDisappear trigger also has
     similar problem, so we have to use our old friend GeometryReader to actually read the origin and pass the x
     value as our offset
     
     Because of the wrapper nature of NavigationSplitView, AppKit has a different behavior.
     Unlike UIKit where this will be emitted with the origin being a negative value equals to the width,
     AppKit emits the origin change twice, one before the animation and one after.
     The first one has the same value as UIKit and the second one can be either 0 or a positive value.
     We will want to prevent the positive one being emitted as it will confuse our NowPlayingBar.

     We need this because the modifier will only be applied to the root view of the NavigationStack, and
     to add the NowPlayingBarModifier to each and every view in the stack maually is just horrible.
     Also we can only embeded a NavigationSplitView inside a TabView but not the other way around.
     This makes the the SwiftUI way of size negotialtion almost impossible.
     Use GeometryReader is the only reliable way to determine the max width for our floating player.
